Assignment:

Create a circuit with two switches S1 and S2 and two LEDs L1 and L2.

Configure each switch input to be PULL-UP.

When S1 is pressed L1 should toggle indicating that S2 is enabled or disabled.

When L1 is illuminated, pressing S2 should illuminate L2, releasing S2 should extinguish L2.

When L1 is extinguished, pressing S2 should have no effect on L2 

Note 1: A simple delay of 100ms can be used to debounce S1. 

Note 2: No debouncing is needed for S2.
